# WELCOME TO YOUR VS CODE EXTENSION

## WHAT'S IN THE FOLDER

* THIS FOLDER CONTAINS ALL OF THE FILES NECESSARY FOR YOUR COLOR THEME EXTENSION.
* `PACKAGE.JSON` - THIS IS THE MANIFEST FILE THAT DEFINES THE LOCATION OF THE THEME FILE AND SPECIFIES THE BASE THEME OF THE THEME.
* `THEMES/ROHIT-COLOR-THEME.JSON` - THE COLOR THEME DEFINITION FILE.

## GET UP AND RUNNING STRAIGHT AWAY

* PRESS `F5` TO OPEN A NEW WINDOW WITH YOUR EXTENSION LOADED.
* OPEN `FILE > PREFERENCES > COLOR THEMES` AND PICK YOUR COLOR THEME.
* OPEN A FILE THAT HAS A LANGUAGE ASSOCIATED. THE LANGUAGES' CONFIGURED GRAMMAR WILL TOKENIZE THE TEXT AND ASSIGN 'SCOPES' TO THE TOKENS. TO EXAMINE THESE SCOPES, INVOKE THE `DEVELOPER: INSPECT EDITOR TOKENS AND SCOPES` COMMAND FROM THE COMMAND PALETTE (`CTRL+SHIFT+P` OR `CMD+SHIFT+P` ON MAC).

## MAKE CHANGES

* CHANGES TO THE THEME FILE ARE AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED TO THE EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT HOST WINDOW.

## ADOPT YOUR THEME TO VISUAL STUDIO CODE

* THE TOKEN COLORIZATION IS DONE BASED ON STANDARD TEXTMATE THEMES. COLORS ARE MATCHED AGAINST ONE OR MORE SCOPES.

TO LEARN MORE ABOUT SCOPES AND HOW THEY'RE USED, CHECK OUT THE [COLOR THEME](HTTPS://CODE.VISUALSTUDIO.COM/API/EXTENSION-GUIDES/COLOR-THEME) DOCUMENTATION.
